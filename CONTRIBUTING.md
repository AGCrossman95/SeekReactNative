# Contributing to Seek

The best way to contribute to Seek is to use it. The second best way is to tell your friends about it! But if you want to do even more, here are some other ways to help.

## Code

Seek is an open source React Native application, so if you're familiar with React Native you can help us out with development tasks. Here's how we'd like you to do that:

1. [Set up your dev environment](https://github.com/inaturalist/SeekReactNative#setup-files).
1. Find an [unassigned issue](https://github.com/inaturalist/SeekReactNative/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee) you want to work on. Bugs are the highest priority!
1. Leave a comment on the issue saying you want to work on it so we can assign it to you (and other people know someone's working on it).
1. Fork the repo.
1. Make an issue-specific branch in your repo starting with the issue number, so something like `1234-animation-timing` if the work concerns the timing of an animation. This helps us know what issue a pull request is supposed to fix.
1. Work on the issue in your branch.
1. Make a pull request. We'll try and review it within a week or two.

We can't guarantee that we'll merge all code, and how quickly we can review PRs depends on what other things we're working on. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

## Translations

All of Seek's translation is crowdsourced via [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/seek), so please head over there and read the project description if you'd like to add or update translations.

## Donations

iNaturalist is a non-profit providing free services with no ads. If you'd like to keep it that way, [please consider becoming a Monthly Supporter](https://www.inaturalist.org/monthly-supporters) at any amount. Seriously, every bit helps.

## Ideas

**If you have ideas for features or improvements, please do not make issues in this Github repo.** We try to use issues for things that are ready for developers to work on. Instead, [start a topic in the Forum](https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/about-the-feature-requests-category-please-read-before-posting/69), tag it `Seek`, and describe your idea so it can be discussed. If iNat staff agrees it's worth doing, we'll make a Github issue for it.
